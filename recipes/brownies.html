    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This brownie recipe is the bomb! I've found the perfect combination of ingredients to make the fudgiest brownies ever.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition, until thoroughly blended.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, cocoa powder, and salt into a separate large bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into egg mixture until blended; stir in chocolate chips. Spread batter evenly into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing into 24 squares.</li>
    </ol>
